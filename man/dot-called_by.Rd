\title{Called By}
\usage{
.called_by(fname, all_functions, pkg_env)
}
\arguments{
\item{fname}{The name of the target function.}

\item{all_functions}{A character vector of all function names in the project.}

\item{pkg_env}{The package environment where the functions are defined (e.g. global).}
}
\value{
A data.table with two columns ("from" and "to") representing the dependencies
of the target function. Returns NA if no dependencies are found.
}
\description{
Identify functions called by a given function within a specified project folder
}
\details{
The function identifies functions called by the target function \code{fname} within the specified
package environment \code{pkg_env}. It searches for dependencies within the literal code of the
function body and returns a data.table with two columns ("from" and "to") representing the
dependencies. If no dependencies are found, it returns a data.table with "from" as the target
function and "to" as NA.

Note: This function may potentially miss calls if they are in attributes of the closure. For example
when function is defined within another function, capturing the environment of the outer function.
