Description: An R package designed to help health economic modellers when writing unit tests for their models. The asserts contained in this package include black-box and white-box tests for common errors in health economic models. They are not designed to be exhaustive, but rather to provide a starting point with a set of 'standard' tests to free up modellers to focus on tests specific to the individual model in development or review.
